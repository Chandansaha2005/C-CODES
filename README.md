Welcome to my C programming repository!

This repo is a collection of C programs I’m writing as part of my daily learning and problem-solving journey. My aim is to **track my progress**, **solidify my fundamentals**, and **help others** who are learning C from the ground up.

## 📬 How to Use

1. Browse folders by topic  
2. Open the `.c` files and follow the in-code comments  
3. Compile and run using a terminal (`gcc filename.c -o output`) or any IDE  
4. Experiment and tweak the code to learn more!
